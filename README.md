Data Visualization: Bar Chart & Histogram
Overview

This project demonstrates how to create a bar chart or histogram to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable in a population dataset. Typical examples include the distribution of genders (categorical) or ages (continuous).

Objectives

Understand the difference between categorical and continuous variables

Visualize data distributions using appropriate chart types

Gain insights into population characteristics through visual analysis

Chart Types
Bar Chart (Categorical Data)

Used to represent counts or frequencies of categories (e.g., gender, education level).

X-axis: Categories

Y-axis: Frequency or count

Histogram (Continuous Data)

Used to show the distribution of numerical values (e.g., age).

X-axis: Value ranges (bins)

Y-axis: Frequency

Dataset

The dataset should contain at least one:

Categorical variable (e.g., gender)

Continuous variable (e.g., age)

Example columns:

age

gender

Tools & Libraries

Common tools used for this task include:

Python

Pandas (data handling)

Matplotlib or Seaborn (visualization)

Steps

Load the dataset

Select the variable to analyze

Choose the appropriate chart type

Plot the chart

Interpret the distribution

Expected Output

A bar chart showing the frequency of each category ( male vs female)

A histogram showing how values ( ages) are distributed across ranges

Use Cases

Demographic analysis


Reporting and presentations

Conclusion

Bar charts and histograms are fundamental visualization techniques that help quickly understand data distributions and pat
